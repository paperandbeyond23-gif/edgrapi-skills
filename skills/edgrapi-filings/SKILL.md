# edgrapi-filings

Company profiles and recent SEC filings from EDGAR via [Edgrapi.com](https://edgrapi.com). The focused two-tool variant of `edgrapi-full` — install this when you need filer metadata and disclosure history, not financial statements.

Use when the user **explicitly asks** who/what a filer is (CIK, industry, fiscal-year end, exchange) or for a company's recent SEC filings.

## When to use this skill

Each call consumes an Edgrapi request against the account's plan quota. Activate only for a genuine lookup about a specific company — not when a ticker appears in passing.

## Tools

### `get_company`
CIK, legal name, SIC industry, fiscal-year end, exchanges, and website, resolved from EDGAR submissions. Args: `ticker` (required).

### `get_filings`
Recent filings with filing/report dates and document links. Args: `ticker` (required), `limit` (1–100, default 20), `form` (optional filter, e.g. `10-K`, `10-Q`, `8-K`).

## Authentication

Set `EDGRAPI_KEY` to your Edgrapi key (`edgr_...`), sent as the `X-API-Key` header.

```bash
export EDGRAPI_KEY="edgr_..."
```

Free key (100 requests/day, no card) at <https://edgrapi.com/app>.

## Pricing

Free 100/day · Starter $9/mo (50k) · Pro $29/mo (250k) · Business $99/mo (1M). See <https://edgrapi.com/pricing>.

## Errors

Functions return a dict; on failure it has an `error` key: `auth_required`, `auth_invalid`, `ticker_not_found`, `rate_limit_exceeded`, `rapidapi_only`, `edgar_unavailable`, `network`, `HTTP <code>`, `unexpected`.
