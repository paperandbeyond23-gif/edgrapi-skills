# edgrapi-fundamentals

Clean financial statements and ratios from SEC EDGAR via [Edgrapi.com](https://edgrapi.com). The focused two-tool variant of `edgrapi-full` — install this when you only need the numbers, not filings/profile lookups.

Use when the user **explicitly asks** for a US-listed company's financials: revenue, net income, assets, debt, cash flow, EPS, margins, ROE/ROA, leverage, or liquidity.

## When to use this skill

Each call spends one Edgrapi credit (1 credit = 1 request). Activate only for a genuine financials request about a specific company — not when a ticker appears in passing, and not for live stock **prices** (Edgrapi is filings-derived fundamentals, not a price feed).

## Tools

### `get_fundamentals`
Normalized income-statement, balance-sheet, and cash-flow figures, parsed from EDGAR XBRL companyfacts. Args: `ticker` (required), `period` (`annual` | `quarterly`, default `annual`), `limit` (1–20, default 5). Periodized by fiscal period end, in USD.

### `get_ratios`
Margins, returns, leverage, and liquidity ratios derived from the fundamentals. Args: `ticker` (required). Price-based ratios (P/E, P/B) are **not** included — EDGAR carries no market price.

## Authentication

Set `EDGRAPI_KEY` to your Edgrapi key (`edgr_...`), sent as the `X-API-Key` header.

```bash
export EDGRAPI_KEY="edgr_..."
```

## Errors

Functions return a dict; on failure it has an `error` key: `auth_required`, `auth_invalid`, `ticker_not_found`, `out_of_credits`, `rapidapi_only`, `edgar_unavailable`, `network`, `HTTP <code>`, `unexpected`.
